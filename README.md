AI Agent which converts text into SQL Query.  
To begin the project, a virtual environment was created and all required dependencies were installed using the requirements.txt file.

1. After installation, the SQLite database was created by loading the provided CSV files. These files were converted into structured tables which are then used to execute SQL queries generated by the AI.

2. The Flask application was set up to take user input from the web page, send the question to the language model, get the SQL query in return, execute it on the SQLite database, and finally show the result back in the browser.

3. Llama3 was integrated using Ollama to convert natural questions into SQL queries. It runs completely offline, and the model is used in real-time whenever a user submits a question.

4. The frontend of the project was designed using HTML and CSS to allow users to type their questions and view the results clearly. Bar charts were also added for numeric-based outputs to enhance visualization.

5. To run the project, Ollama is started first to activate the model. Then, the Flask app is launched using Python, and the web interface is accessed from the browser to ask questions and view results.
